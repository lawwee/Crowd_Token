The main purpose of the project is to allow interested individuals be able to buy the tokens associated with the project that is being worked on.
A lot of research had to be done in regards to the project due to the fact that OpenZeppelin no longer supported the crowdsale implementation.

Herein lies the functionalities available to all users on the platform.
